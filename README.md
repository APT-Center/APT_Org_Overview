### User Type: Org Admin
There are 2 types of administrators: org admins and team admins. The below table describes the roles and responsibilities of both types:

Org admins are users who have full control and access rights to all members, repositories, and teams.

Org Admins have the following responsibilities:
- Adding / removing members from the GitHub organization
- Granting org admin access
- Providing guidance to team admins on APT Org GitHub teams

**\*\*While org admins have the privilege to create teams and repos, we recommend that team admins do these tasks. This ensures that org admins don't become the bottleneck for creation of repos, teams, adding / removing team members. This would quickly become an unscalable process and burden on the org admins.**

### User Type: Team Admin
Team admins are users who are the technical and project leader(s) of their respective projects. A project is an area of research (e.g. LESensory) and may have many repositories associated with it.

Team Admins have the following responsibilities:
- Adding / removing org members from the team
- Adding / removing external members from the team
- Creating and managing project repositories

### User Type: Org Members
Org Members are permanent and semi-permanent users within the APT Center. These may include:
-	All TDL engineers
-	All project managers (investigators or PIs)
-	Relevant permanent project staff (permanent > 6 months)
-	6-month co-ops
-	Relevant PhD students

Org members have the following responsibilities:
- Contributing to and reading from repositories

**\*\*While org members have the privilege to create teams and repos, we recommend that only team admins do these tasks. This ensures that each repository is set up with appropriate access rights for administrators.**

### User Type: External Collaborators
External Collaborators are temporary contributors to projects. These may include:
-	External contractors
-	Student interns

External Collaborators should generally not have access to the full set of team repositories, and should be added on an individual repository basis.
